・BPIとは<br>
BPI<br>
Beat Power Indicater<br>
<br>
・BPI is an indicator for evaluating IIDX skill, especially for skilled players.<br>
*0 point in BPI is kaiden-average.<br>
*100 point is world record (on PENDUAL).<br>
・This is originally made for evaluating top-rankers.<br>
・Calculation method is a little bit complicated.<br>
(http://norimiso.web.fc2.com/about.txt detail is shown here, though Japanese.)<br>
(if needed, I'll try to translate into English.)<br>
・I recommend for those who want to know how good my score, which exceeds AAA, is.<br>
・0 point in BPI means roughly top 2000, because there're about 4000 kaidens in IIDX(SP)<br>
・10 for top 1000, 20 for top 500, and so on.<br>
・You can use this if you want to know a song's kaiden-average and world record.<br>
*but if world record is MAX, BPI cannot calculate properly.<br>
*you can know Lv.12's kaiden-average and world record below URL<br>
http://norimiso.web.fc2.com/1/bpitable.html (simple BPI table)<br>
(0 for kaiden-average, 100 for world record)<br>
・Originally, there're overall BPI, which is calculated from BPI of all lv.12 songs<br>
*overall BPI can express one's proficiency numerically.<br>
*overall BPI is not mere arithmetic mean.<br>
(if you want to know detail, also shown in above URL.)<br>
・I know this website is really cheap, but I don't have any programming skills, so this is my limit.<br>
